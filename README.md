## Made following refactor changes to original repository:
* Wrote relevant comments in both HTML and CSS files that describe what elements are which.
* Added <a href=”/”></a> (topmost directory link) anchor to “Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n” in header.
* Added alt=”…” descriptions for all images for accessibility reasons.
* Extra <img> tag after “Benefit-cost” image tag
* No semantic HTML present at start. Added <nav>, <header> and <footer> where necessary and changed corresponding CSS to match.
* Added / anchor to header.
* Changed hero section from generic div element to section element.
* Changed heading in footer from h2 to h4.
* Added article and section elements in benefits section. Consolidated CSS for images in benefits section.
